# Dining Philosophers Problem

This code simulates the problem of philosophers eating.
It creates a thread for each philosopher and using sleep statement it simulates philosopher thinking and eating.
It uses LEFT_PHIL and RIGHT_PHIL macros to represent the left and right fork of each philosopher respectively.
It also has an infinite loop to simulate the philosophers' continuous eating and thinking.

It has a variation in 2 of the parts, which includes only 2 bowls to eat from, however there can't be more than 2 philosophers
eating at once at any given point of time, therefore it wouldn't affect the algorithm by much.
